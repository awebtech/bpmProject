    System requirements
    ===================

    Feng Office requires a web server, PHP (5.0 or greater) and MySQL (InnoDB
    support recommended). The recommended web server is Apache.

    Feng Office is not PHP4 compatible and it will not run on PHP versions prior
    to PHP5.

    Recommended:

    PHP 5.2+
    MySQL 4.1+ with InnoDB support
    Apache 2.0+

        * PHP    : http://www.php.net/
        * MySQL  : http://www.mysql.com/
        * Apache : http://www.apache.org/

    Alternatively, if you just want to test Feng Office and you don't care about security
    issues with your files, you can download XAMPP, which includes all that is needed
    by Feng Office (Apache, PHP 5, MySQL) in a single download.
    You can configure MySQL to support InnoDB by commenting or removing
    the line 'skip-innodb' in the file '<INSTALL_DIR>/etc/my.cnf'.

        * XAMPP  : http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp


    Installation
    ============

    1. Download Feng Office - http://fengoffice.com/web/community/
    2. Unpack and upload to your web server
    3. Direct your browser to the public/install directory and follow the installation
    procedure

    You should be finished in a matter of minutes.
    
    4. Some functionality may require further configuration, like setting up a cron job.
    Check the wiki for more information: http://fengoffice.com/web/wiki/doku.php/setup
    
    WARNING: Default memory limit por PHP is 8MB. As a new Feng Office install consumes about 10 MB,
    administrators could get a message similar to "Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted".
    This can be solved by setting "memory_limit=32" in php.ini.
